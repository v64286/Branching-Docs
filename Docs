# Developer Git Standards

## PR standards:
### 24 Hour Cool down:
A PR can be merged if and only if one of the three scenarios are true:

- The PR has been open for 24 hours and has 2+ approvals 
- The PR has a majority of Developers in MAP Org for approvals. 
- EX: 8 code contributors (including self) requires 4+ approvals.
- EX: 7 code contributors (including self) requires 4+ approvals.
- PR is a small/quick bugfix and has 2+ approvals (and has an open incident ticket)


*Note:* A code contributor is anyone who has make a commit within the last month - title agnostic

### PR Descriptions:
The PR should have a description of what's on it so it's understandable for someone without a deep context of what's going on with the project. Please use the template and remove any of the default information that is not required for your PR.

- Add 'Labels' on each PR. Enhancement, Bug etc... This will make it easier when going back in time through old PR's
- If the PR is considered 'large' either with lines of code, or complexity, we encourage a mini PR review meeting with someone on the PR panel to help speed up the review time.
- 1 PR per story
- Require code owners to review â†’ TODO: we want to have PR 'on call list' that will rotate weekly to ensure the same few devs aren't the only reviewers. We can filter on extension. IE: .tf files we have our DevOps developer required for any PR.
### EX:
